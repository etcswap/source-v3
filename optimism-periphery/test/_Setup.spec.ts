/**
 * @notice In the ordinary Uniswap V3 contracts, all bytecode is constant and deterministic, and therefore the
 * POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH is constant as well. For the OVM, libraries were added to reduce contract size, which means the
 * pool bytecode is now dependent on the library addresses, which are dependent on the deployers account and nonce.
 * To ensure we always end up with the same bytecode, we add this Setup test which should always be the first test
 * ran. If you only want to run one test file, use `.only` modifiers on this test file and the desired test file,
 * instead of specifying the file name in the test command. We also deploy WETH one time here because it is a
 * constructor argument and we want to ensure the WETH address is always safe to use as a constructor argument
